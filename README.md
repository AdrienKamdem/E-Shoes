# E-Shoes

## Web development project 
## E-business website

### Goal
The goal is a simple creation of an e-business website named E-shoes. As the name indicate it, it's a selling shoes website, where customers can only purchase shoes. It's composed by many features, imposed by the website industry, enabling a smoother usage. 
I proceed by step to build it as we do for any project. Sneak a peek at the steps down below.

### First step
I created the Home Page named (index.html), and other pages like the basket page, forms pages etc... composed by an header, a menu, a principal part, and a footer with hmtl and css.
The principal part is composed by the different catalog pages.

### Second step
I added features like zoom on any product pictures, quantity commanded, add to basket and forms verification with JS/DOM.

### Third Step
I factored my code using including files with PHP.
I also created session on each pages, stock session variables on another files and finally transfer informations from categories and products to .txt files.

### Fourth and last step
I created a SQL script enabling the database structure creation. Then I created a second SQL script enabling the data insertion into the database. I also used AJAX to modify stocks when customers click on buttons add and command for a product.
